# Backlog

Alarm-only cross-exchange arbitrage detector. Tracks what's built, what's next, and open design decisions.

---

## Done

- **Pair fetcher** (`pair-fetcher/fetcher.ts`) — fetches 24h volume for all pairs per exchange (Binance `/api/v3/ticker/24hr`, Bybit `/v5/market/tickers?category=spot`); writes to `pair_snapshots` table in `arb.db`; runs on startup then every N hours (`--interval`). Mock endpoints added for both exchanges.
- **SQLite storage** via `better-sqlite3` — `opportunities`, `prices`, `ticks` tables; synchronous writes alongside JSONL audit logs (`arbitrage-detector/db.ts`, `logger.ts`)
- **Integration tests migrated to SQLite** — all 47 tests query the DB; each suite runs in an isolated `logs/` dir wiped before the run
- **Web dashboard** — independent Express process in `dashboard/`; reads DB readonly; polls `/api/snapshot` every 2s; shows live detector status, open opportunity, latest prices per pair, recent opportunities table, aggregate stats
- **`.gitignore`** — covers `node_modules/`, `logs/`, `dist/`, `*.db`, `.env`, `.DS_Store`

## Backlog

### Dockerize
Run the full stack with `docker-compose up`.

Three services:
- `mock` — mock-exchanges server (port 3000)
- `detector` — arbitrage-detector, writes to a shared `arb.db` volume
- `dashboard` — dashboard server (port 4000), reads same `arb.db` volume

Shared DB via a named Docker volume mounted into both `detector` and `dashboard`. The `detector` should wait for `mock` to be healthy before starting (in dev/test mode). In prod mode, `mock` is not needed — `detector` points at real exchange URLs via `.env`.

---

### Timing resolution
Track how precisely we know when an opportunity opened and closed.

**Close resolution** (`close_resolution_ms`): time between last tick and convergence detection — easy, derived from actual tick timestamps already stored.

**Open resolution** (`open_resolution_ms`): time since the pair was last scanned before detection. Requires `lastScannedAt: Map<string, number>` in the main detector loop, updated each scan, passed into `OpportunityTracker.open()`. First scan after startup = `NULL` (unknown).

Per-exchange granularity: track `lastSuccessfulFetchAt` per exchange in `ExchangeClient`. `open_resolution_ms` = `max(buy_gap, sell_gap)` — worst case wins.

Dashboard impact: show duration as a range (`12ms – 5.2s`) when resolution is low, rather than a single misleading number.

Schema columns to add to `opportunities`: `open_resolution_ms INTEGER`, `close_resolution_ms INTEGER`.

---

### Dashboard enhancements
- Tick-by-tick detail view for a selected opportunity (spread over time while open)
- Filter/sort recent opportunities by pair, exchange, or date range
- Price history retention policy — rolling window or prune by age to keep DB size bounded
- Duration range display once resolution tracking is implemented
- **Pair volume section** — surface `pair_snapshots` data: show 24h USDT volume per pair/exchange, flag pairs where our capital would exceed X% of daily volume (configurable threshold)

---

## Design decisions on record

- **JSONL kept in parallel** alongside SQLite as a flat audit log — human-readable, zero-dep recovery option
- **Dashboard is read-only** — no controls exposed via the web UI
- **Independent processes** — detector, dashboard, and mock-exchanges are three separate processes; dashboard reads SQLite directly, no IPC needed
- **`exchange_buy` / `exchange_sell`** field names kept in schema (matches detector internals); future rename to `exchange_cheap` / `exchange_expensive` deferred until resolution tracking is added (at which point the semantic distinction matters more)
